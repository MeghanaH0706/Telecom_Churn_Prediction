What is customer churn?

Customer churn, also known as customer retention, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the 
loss of clients or customers.

Churn rates are calculated by dividing the number of customers who cancel their account in each month by the 
total number of customers at the beginning of that same month, then multiplying the result by 100.

Example:
3,000 / 10,000 * 100 = 30% Churn Rate

Telephone service companies use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of 
their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring 
a new one.
Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to 
win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a 
company than newly recruited clients.

Companies usually make a distinction between voluntary churn and involuntary churn.Voluntary 
churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, 
involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care 
facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for 
churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, 
because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies’ 
control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.

predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their 
propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small, prioritized list of potential defectors, 
they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer 
base who are most vulnerable to churn.
